PROJECT ELROY

This code was used in a project during grade 12 computer engineering.
Project works on Raspberry Pi 4 B with a USB sound card and various breadboarded components to
create a voice controlled way to perform tasks like basic mathematical calculations and information
retrieving systems. Python and Java scripts return exit codes to the BASH script which is in charge of 
controlling which scripts get executed and when, conditionally.
